This repo is the source code for a fantasy AI bot I'm developing.

The plan is :
To have a recurrent neural network be able to forecast an individual player's stat
line through calculating features derived from various statistical metrics from  
all NBA boxscore data in the 3-point era (1980 season and beyond).


Additionally, playernotes data scraped from rotoworld.com will be rolled into a second layer 
of machine learning using a state vector machine to do natural language processing to evaluate
a player's availability on any given night, searching for player injuries, trades, and suspensions 
from the playernotes data.

Finally, plug the trained model into the yahoo fantasy sports API to control the live version.

As a bonus, I'm considering setting up my own kubernetes cluster to aid in some of the larger
data crunching operations this will have to do. Utilizing an old PS3 I've converted into a linux 
box.
