This repo is the source code for a fantasy AI bot I'm developing.

The plan is :
To have a recurrent neural network be able to forecast an individual player's stat
line through calculating features derived from various statistical metrics from  
all NBA boxscore data in the 3-point era (1980 season and beyond).


Additionally, playernotes data scraped from rotoworld.com will be rolled into a second layer 
of machine learning using a state vector machine to do natural language processing to evaluate
a player's availability on any given night, searching for player injuries, trades, and suspensions 
from the playernotes data.

Finally, plug the trained model into the yahoo fantasy sports API to control the live version.

As a bonus, I'm considering setting up my own kubernetes cluster to aid in some of the larger
data crunching operations this will have to do. Utilizing an old PS3 I've converted into a linux 
box.

--------
Current state : 
-I've set up and tested the 'league' functionality. A collection of team objects, matchups, schedule,
as well as the rules for determining the winners of the weekly matchups and the league overall.
-I've scraped the data required and set up the database, as well as indexed the data so it can be used
programmatically.  Also created a pair of web scrapers that should continue to update the databases with
new data as it's generated hands free (or as long as my upstream data creators don't change their websites)
-In the 'scratch' folder you can find a bunch of one-off queries used for setting up my tables, as well as 
some of the scraped source data
--------
Technology used :
python3.7 as the base-language
mysql as the database
tensorflow for the machine learning components
pandas for the input vector data to tensorflow
selenium for 
git for sharing to anyone interested as well as versioning control
