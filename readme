This repo is the source code for a fantasy AI bot I'm developing.

The plan is :
To have a recurrent neural network be able to forecast an individual player's stat
line through calculating features derived from various statistical metrics from  
all NBA boxscore data in the 3-point era (1980 season and beyond).


Additionally, playernotes data scraped from rotoworld.com will be rolled into a second layer 
of machine learning using a state vector machine to do natural language processing to evaluate
a player's availability on any given night, searching for player injuries, trades, and suspensions 
from the playernotes data.

Finally, plug the trained model into the yahoo fantasy sports API to control the live version.

As a bonus, I'm considering setting up my own kubernetes cluster to aid in some of the larger
data crunching operations this will have to do. Utilizing an old PS3 I'll convert into a linux 
box.  (EDIT : evidently, Sony took away this feature of the ps3 in 2010.  It's still possible
but much more difficult to do now)

The 'scratch' folder contains a lot of the one-off sql queries used to set up my tables, or smaller 
functions I can use when testing the addition of new functionality
--------
Current state : 
-I've set up and tested the 'league' functionality. A collection of team objects, matchups, schedule,
as well as the rules for determining the winners of the weekly matchups and the league overall.
-I've scraped the data required and set up the database, as well as indexed the data so it can be used
programmatically.  Also created a pair of web scrapers that should continue to update the databases with
new data as it's generated hands free (or as long as my upstream data creators don't change their websites)
-I've added a generalized function to add any new features I come up with to my features set.
--------
Next Up : 
- Add a few more precalculated features
- create a generalized function to append new boxscores to my table of calculated features
- feed the calculated features into tensorflow and have a rough first RNN algorithm
--------
Technology used :
python3.7 as the base-language
mysql as the database
tensorflow for the machine learning components
pandas for the input vector data to tensorflow
selenium for web scraping
git for sharing to anyone interested as well as versioning control
